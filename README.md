# workday-scheduler

A simple planner application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.

The application displays the current date and time, a schedule of events or notes for 1-hour blocks of time starting at 9am and ending at 5pm. The block of time is colored purple if it is in the past, white if it is the present hour, and green if it is in the future.

# installation

No installation necessary. The application is available at the following URL:

# roadmap

The scheduler notes are saved and appear when page reloads. There will also be an option to clear out notes.
